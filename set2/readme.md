TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I have learned how to do for loops and nested for loops as well as learning how to use if statements and some basic forms of mathematics. I am overall happy with what I have learned this week but I wish to know how I could have improved my loop 7 script so that it becomes universal for all size inputs.
